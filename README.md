# crosswordGenerator
This program accepts a list of words into an array list of strings, then generates a 20x20 matrix of characters that contains a crossword puzzle with the given words. A legal placement of a word is as follows: 
  1. All the characters of the word must lie on the 20x20 matrix grid.
  2. If the word is not the first word, it must intersect with one or more words on the puzzle.
  3. The placement of a word cannot create any new 'words' (it cannot be adjacent to any letter which is not in the word(s) with which the word intersects).
